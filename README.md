# fsmapper-docs

This repository contains the source for the [fsmapper](https://github.com/opiopan/fsmapper) documentation to be published on the [GitHub Pages](https://opiopan.github.io/fsmapper-docs/).
I haven't deployed it to GitHub Pages yet because the manuscript is still in progress.
I plan to deploy it once we've written a significant portion of it.

This contents will be built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

```
$ git clone https://github.com/fsmapper-docs.git
$ cd fsmapper-docs
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
